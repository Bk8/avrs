/* Based on ...
 STK order 4 single input, single output feedback
 delay network, with each delay line cascaded by
 a one-pole lowpass filter. There is also a tone
 correction filter.

 This private class implements an order 4 SISO FDN
 with B = [1,1,1,1]^T, C = [1,1,1,1]^T, and feedback
 matrix A = A_4, where A_N = gA*(I_N - (2/N)*u_N*(u_N)^T).
 (I_N denotes the N by N identity matrix, and
 u_N = [1,...,1]^T, an N-vector of ones.) Each delay is
 cascaded by a lowpass filter according to the
 difference equation:
 y_i(n) = g_i(1-a_i)*x_i(n) + a_i*y_i(n-1)
 where the subscript i = {1,2,3,4} denotes each of the
 4 delay lines. A tone correction filter is applied
 to the FDN output and summed with the input sample
 to produce the final system output.

 You set the reverberation time at DC and at half the
 sampling rate, the gain coefficient gA of the A matrix,
 and the delay line lengths of each of the 4 delay lines
 during instantiation. The default constructor sets up a
 0-sample length for each delay line with gA = 0.0, g_i = 1.0,
 and a_i = 0.0 for all i and no tone correction (resulting in
 no delay, feedback, or filtering).
